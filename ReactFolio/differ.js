// The main difference between onClick={() => setCategory(data.title)} and onClick={setCategory(data.title)} is when the setCategory function is called

// In the first case, onClick={() = setCategory(data.title)}, an arrow function is used as a callback function for the onClick event handler.
// This means that when the element is clicked, the arrow function will be executed and then call the setCategory function with the data.title argument.
// This is useful when you need to perform some additional logic or calculations before calling the setCategory function.

// In the second case, onClick={setCategory (data.title)}, the setCategory function is called immediately when the component is rendered,
// and the return value of the setCategory function is assigned to the onClick event handler.
// This is not desirable because it will call the setCategory function on every render, which can lead to unnecessary re-renders and performance issues.

// Therefore, the correct way to pass a function with arguments to an onClick event handler in React is to use the first approach with an arrow function as
// follows: onClick={() = setCategory(data.title)}. This way, the setCategory function will only be called when the element is clicked, and not on every render.
