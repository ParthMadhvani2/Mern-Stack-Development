        <!-- Div Tag 
        The <div> tag defines a division or a section 
            in an HTML document.

The <div> tag is used as a container for HTML elements 
    - which is then styled with CSS or manipulated 
    with JavaScript.

The <div> tag is easily styled by using the class 
    or id attribute.

Any sort of content can be put inside the <div> tag! 

Note: By default, browsers always place a line 
break before and after the <div> element.
